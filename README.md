<h1>What is this project all about?</h1>
This project is part of the university course "Business Information Systems" at the University of Innsbruck by Stefan HÃ¤ussler and Ulrich Remus.

For this project, we were tasked to compare the punctuality between airline XXX and airline YYY, and determine whether the complaints from airline YYY regarding the performance of airline XXX is justified.. To accomplish this, the author uses Python with Panda library, as this library is very widely used in data analysis. For the graph generation the author decides to use Seaborn library.
